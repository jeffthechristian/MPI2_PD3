3. Expected application example:
Create an application for training purposes. You are allowed to create an
application using online development environment only
(https://snack.expo.io/), just remember to add the application to source code
repository (Bitbucket, Gitlab, Github). Introduction to React Native has been
provided for the first year IT students. This is a quick repetition assignment.
This application will demonstrate how cross platform development
frameworks can speed up and ease application development processes.
The application will consist of only one screen. The application will need to
acquire device location, show location on Google Maps and will need to
acquire weather forecast information for the device location from open
weather api (see 1.image).
The application has to work on ios, android and web platforms. Application
has to work on landscape and portrait modes.
